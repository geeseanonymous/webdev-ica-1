    "I can't tell you how much I love Azusa. I want to examine her eyes up close, comfort her delicate wings with all of my sanctity, run my fingers through her soft yet perfect-seeming hair. I want to caress her whole body, not leave every centimeter untouched, massage her sweet head, care for her cheeks, touch and admire her toes and fingers while protecting her sacred legs with all my strength and dignity. How I wish to have a single glimpse of holy Azusa before my death, and store that deep in my mind to revoke at the moment of life's end to depart in bliss. Every time I just think of Azusa, if I haven't averted the sight of this goddess, I am filled with eternal happiness and contentment in all ways, so that even in the most difficult times of my life I have a reason to keep going. Every night I lie on my Azusa body pillow, face crying with joy as I replay scenarios of how I would exchange words with holy Azusa. I dream of her with her hands in mine, sitting on a bank of our city's hill, hidden under the night starry sky, our faces close, her eyes closed as I reach for a tender, protective kiss. Every day I step out of my bed just for Azusa. Every day I can't think of anything but Azusa. Every day I live only for Azusa. Come into my care, into my arms, I will heal you, I will take care of you, I will guarantee to fight for you with all my willpower and vitality until my last breath. I love you Azusa!!",
